## Introduction

Welcome to the Generative AI Mario Game project! In this UX/AI hackathon project, we are creating an exciting Mario game where everything, from virtual backgrounds and background objects to game sounds and main character assets, is generated using the power of Generative AI. Our ultimate goal is to provide an intuitive user experience where players can generate their own game levels through a chat-based interface.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to leverage the capabilities of Generative AI to create a unique and dynamic Mario gaming experience. Here are the key components of our project:

- **AI-Generated Assets**: We're using Generative AI to create virtual backgrounds, background objects, game sounds, and even the main character's assets. This results in a game world that is constantly evolving and never repetitive.

- **Intuitive UI**: We're developing an intuitive user interface that allows players to interact with the AI and generate their own game levels. The chat-based interface will make it easy for users to customize various aspects of the game.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/generative-ai-mario-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd generative-ai-mario-game
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. Please refer to the documentation for specific installation instructions.

4. Run the project locally using the provided instructions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `assets/`: This directory contains the AI-generated assets used in the game.

- `src/`: The source code for the game, including the AI integration and user interface.

- `docs/`: Documentation and guides for the project.

- `examples/`: Example chat-based interactions and level generation.

## Roadmap

Our project roadmap is divided into several phases:

1. **Hackathon POC**:
   - Change background color, image, and sounds.
   - Intuitive UI for level creation with generated assets.
   - Basic chat-based level creation.
    
2. **MVP Development**:
   - Customization of non-interacting assets.
   - Interacting asset generation (e.g., pipes).
   - Experimentation with changing game mechanics through AI prompts.

3. **Future Vision**:
   - Multi-modal product allowing players to create game assets and mechanics using text.
   - Intuitive drag-and-drop UI for level creation.
   -  - **Voice-Driven Game Levels**: We envision creating substantially large game levels that can generate scenes based on voice input from the player. The AI will adapt the gameplay experience in response to voice commands, creating dynamic and immersive gameplay scenarios.
   - **Player Experience Integration**: To enhance player engagement, we plan to incorporate machine learning algorithms that consider a player's past playthrough experience. The game will adapt its difficulty, level design, and challenges based on the player's skill level and preferences, providing a personalized gaming experience.
